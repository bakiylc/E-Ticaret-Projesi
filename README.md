## üöÄ Overview
Welcome to the **E-Commerce Data Analysis Project!** In this project, we are digging into the E-Commerce dataset using Power BI to create meaningful insights for an E-Commerce company, including customer behavior, sales channel comparisons, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Through this analysis, we discover key metrics such as key customer demographics such as gender and age classification, as well as most purchased products, number of orders per month and year, and percentage distribution of platforms from which orders are received.

The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for better business planning, sales-focused decisions, and targeted customer strategies.

## üí° Key Insights and Reports

### 1. **Average Properties Owned by Gender**
This report provides a segmented breakdown of products purchased by customers based on gender, providing deeper insights into the gender distribution of orders.

**2. Number of orders by category**
This visualization helps us understand which categories are selling the most. It helps the company identify which products are selling poorly and create a sales plan accordingly.

**3. Customer Loyalty Classification and Total Revenue**
This report highlights the total revenue segmented based on customer loyalty classification. This is critical in determining the revenue distribution between loyal and non-loyal customers.

**4. Number of Products Ordered and Correlation Between Cities**
This report investigates whether there is a significant correlation between the number of orders placed by customers and the city they live in. This analysis can help the company in its sales strategies.

**5. Customer Age Distribution**
It provides us with information about how many customers we have from which age group. It helps determine the customer profile to which the company sells. 
Accordingly, it adds strategic importance in determining new product sales and campaigns.

‚öôÔ∏è **DAX Measures and Functions Used**
